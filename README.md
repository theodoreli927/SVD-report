# Singular Value Decomposition Analysis

Here is my detailed mathematical report on Singular Value Decomposition. Here you will find my report in pdf format, and a jpg and .mat file used in my reproducible python code within my report. 

First I begin with a introduction and explanation of SVD followed by a proof of how any matrix decomposed using SVD can be rewritten as a sum of rank 1 matrices.

Now that I've introduced SVD and their properties, next I analyzed the best rank-k approximation of a matrx 'A', and proved how the 2-norm of A-A_k would be equalto \sigma_{k+1}
